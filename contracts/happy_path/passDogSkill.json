// Possible Errors
//

// "DogSkill Not Found: Your given dog_id and skill_id do not have a matching dog_skill. Please check your inputs"
//
// This error indicates that nothing was found for the given inputs. It may indicate a bad parameter was passed.

// "Warning: 'pass' was already set to 'true' for this dog_skill"
//
// This warning is not code-breaking, but it indicates that the dog_skill you are trying to assign as "true" has already been assigned as such.

// "Server Error: our app's gone off the rails! please report this error to BE team."
//
// This error should never happen. It indicates that none of the expected happy or sad path outcomes occured. This necessitates a code review. 

// "Server Error: We expected your queary to return one result, but found several. Please check your inputs"
//
// This error should never happen. It would imply that a dog was somehow assigned the same skill more than once. This necessitates a code review.
